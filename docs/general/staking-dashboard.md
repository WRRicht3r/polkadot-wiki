:::info Native Ledger Support

The Polkadot Staking Dashboard has native [Ledger](./ledger.md) support, meaning that you do not
need an extension or a wallet to use it, just your Ledger device.

:::

The [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) is a tool that is
dedicated to [staking](../learn/learn-staking.md) on Polkadot,
[Kusama](../learn/learn-kusama-vs-polkadot.md) (Polkadot's canary network) and
[Westend](../maintain/maintain-networks.md#westend-test-network) (Polkadot's test network). The
dashboard is not a wallet, meaning that you cannot transfer funds between accounts. To fund accounts
you can use [third-party wallets](./wallets.md) or the [Polkadot-JS UI](./polkadotjs-ui.md).

You can participate to staking by being a [nominator](../learn/learn-nominator.md) or a
[nomination pool member](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md). For more information visit the
[staking page](../learn/learn-staking.md) and
[advanced staking page](../learn/learn-staking-advanced.md).
